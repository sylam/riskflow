    """Per-step shaping reward on the downside part of the tracking error. Two modes:

    `Dense_Reward_Mode = "asymmetric"` (default, current behavior):
        shaping_t = rs · fp · (max(−err_t, 0) − max(−err_{t+1}, 0))   for non-terminal t
        Terminal transition's shaping is FORCIBLY ZEROED in `reward_and_terminal_payoff`
        (to avoid penalizing the unavoidable force-flat close cost as fresh downside),
        so the telescoping sum is rs·fp·(|downside_0| − |downside_{T-1}|), NOT
        |downside_T|. Combined with the terminal asymmetric utility (−fp·|downside_T|
        on losses), the EFFECTIVE floor penalty is approximately (1 + rs)·fp — exact
        only when |downside_{T-1}| ≈ |downside_T|, i.e. when the close-cost segment
        (bid-offer × position × contract_size) is small relative to total downside.
        For non-trivial close costs the actual coefficient sits between fp and (1+rs)·fp.
        With rs=2, fp=10, sr=1 the agent is optimized as if effective fp ≈ 30 vs sr=1.
        Use rs=1 for terminal-parity (effective fp ≈ 2·fp), rs=0 to disable shaping.

    `Dense_Reward_Mode = "potential_based"` (Ng et al. 1999 PBRS-shaped):
        Φ(s) = −fp · max(−err(s), 0); shaping_t = γ·Φ(s_{t+1}) − Φ(s_t).
        Same terminal-zero applies. **Note**: strict PBRS invariance requires Φ at
        boundaries to be policy-independent (Φ(terminal) = 0 by convention OR boundary
        states reached deterministically). Our terminal-zero implementation effectively
        sets Φ(terminal) = Φ(s_{T-1}), which IS policy-dependent (tracking error at
        T−1 depends on action history). The kept-transitions sum is therefore
        γ^{T-1}·Φ(s_{T-1}) − Φ(s_0), with a small policy-dependent residual
        γ^{T-1}·(−fp·log1p(down_{T-1}/c)) on top of the terminal asymmetric utility.
        Practically the two modes are scalar-multiples of each other modulo rs:
        asymmetric at rs=1 equals fp·(prev_down − next_down) which is exactly PBRS
        shaping with Φ = −fp·down. So the *behavior* is roughly equivalent; the
        "invariance" claim is approximate, not strict. `Dense_Tracking_Reward_Scale`
        is ignored in this mode (scaling Φ would multiply the residual too)."""
